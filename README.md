## Optimization / Mathematical Programming

Mathematical optimization is the study and development of methods focused on finding a numerical solution to a problem that minimizes an objective function, usually a cost. Solving an optimization problem typically includes initially modeling the problem in a set of constraints that limits the acceptable solution set to the problem, and an objetcive function used to compute a cost value of a solution of the problem. An optimization method must be able to solve a set of optimization problems, finding the solution or set of solutions that best solves the problem. "Simplex" and "Interior Points" are some famous methods used to solve optimization problems.

## Quadratic Programming

An expansion of the traditional linear optimization in which the problems actually are described with an objective function with two dimensional space, with a third objective dimension, forming a shape in the three-dimensional space. This type of problem is classified as NP-hard in general cases, but when the shape formed is convex, the problem is actually polinomial.

## Hierarquical Quadratic Programming

Hierarchical quadratic optimization is a specific case of quadratic programming in which several objective variables are minimized according to a strict order of priority.
